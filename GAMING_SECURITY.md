# Gaming Infrastructure Security Guide

## Simplified Security Approach for Family Gaming

You're right that the full security stack can be overkill for family gaming. Here's a **simpler, more practical approach**:

### Option 1: Security Group + Dynamic DNS (Recommended)
```hcl
# In your compute workspace, use a security group that allows:
# - RDP (3389) from your family's ISP blocks
# - Gaming ports from the same ranges
# - ICMP for ping/connectivity testing

# Example security group rules (add to compute workspace):
resource "aws_security_group_rule" "family_rdp" {
  type              = "ingress"
  from_port         = 3389
  to_port           = 3389
  protocol          = "tcp"
  cidr_blocks       = [
    "your-family-member-1-isp-range/24",  # e.g., "192.168.1.0/24"
    "your-family-member-2-isp-range/24",
  ]
  security_group_id = aws_security_group.gaming.id
}
```

### Option 2: AWS Session Manager (Easiest)
- Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager for secure access
- No need to open RDP ports to the internet
- Family members use AWS CLI to connect
- Requires minimal setup and no network configuration

### Option 3: Simple VPN (If needed)
- **WireGuard** (much simpler than OpenVPN)
- Pre-configured client files for each family member
- Only 1 UDP port to manage

## Practical Implementation

### For Unknown IP Addresses:
1. **Start with broad ISP ranges** (most home ISPs use predictable blocks)
2. **Use CloudTrail/VPC Flow Logs** to identify actual source IPs after first connection
3. **Gradually narrow down** the allowed CIDR blocks

### DNS Setup (This Repository):
- Keep the current setup - it's already secure for DNS
- The main security concerns are in the **compute layer** (EC2 instances)

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Move sensitive values to environment variables:**
   ```bash
   export TF_VAR_org="your-terraform-org"
   export TF_VAR_main_zone_id="your-actual-zone-id"
   ```

2. **Use AWS Systems Manager for secrets:**
   - Store gaming server passwords in Parameter Store
   - Reference them in your compute infrastructure

3. **Enable basic monitoring:**
   - CloudWatch for instance health
   - VPC Flow Logs for connection monitoring

## Why This is Sufficient:

- **Gaming traffic is encrypted** by the games themselves
- **RDP over restricted IPs** is reasonably secure for family use
- **AWS infrastructure** provides DDoS protection automatically
- **Cost-effective** compared to enterprise solutions

## When to Upgrade Security:

- If you start allowing **non-family members**
- If you're hosting **competitive/tournament** gaming
- If you store **sensitive personal data** on the gaming PCs
- If your family members travel frequently (unknown IPs)

The key is **proportional security** - match your security investment to your actual risk level.
