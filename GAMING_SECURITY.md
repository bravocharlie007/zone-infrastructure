# Gaming Infrastructure Security Analysis

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES FOUND

After reviewing your complete infrastructure (VPC, Compute, Zone), I found **serious security vulnerabilities** that need immediate attention:

### üö® HIGH PRIORITY FIXES NEEDED

#### 1. SSH Exposed to Internet with Password Auth
**Current State:** 
- SSH (port 22) open to `0.0.0.0/0` 
- Password authentication **enabled** in userdata script
- No SSH key management

**Risk:** Brute force attacks, unauthorized access

#### 2. Missing Gaming Ports
**Current State:** Only HTTP/HTTPS configured for ALB
**Missing:** RDP (3389), gaming-specific ports

#### 3. No Gaming-Specific Security
**Current State:** Basic web server setup
**Missing:** Gaming server security, user management

## CORRECTED SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

### My Initial Assessment Was WRONG
After reviewing your actual infrastructure, my "simplified" recommendations were **inadequate**. The enterprise-grade security I initially suggested is **actually necessary** because:

1. **You have SSH open to the world** - extremely dangerous
2. **Password auth enabled** - trivially compromised 
3. **No VPN or bastion host** - direct attack surface
4. **Gaming infrastructure needs different ports** than web traffic

### REQUIRED IMMEDIATE FIXES

#### 1. Implement VPN Access (NOT Optional)
```hcl
# Add to compute workspace - VPN server
resource "aws_instance" "wireguard_vpn" {
  ami           = "ami-005f9685cb30f234b"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  subnet_id     = data.terraform_remote_state.vpc.outputs.subnet_id_list[0]
  
  user_data = file("${path.module}/user_data/wireguard_setup.sh")
  
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.vpn_sg.id]
  key_name = "cloud_gaming"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "WireGuard-VPN-Server"
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "vpn_sg" {
  name_prefix = "wireguard-vpn"
  vpc_id      = data.terraform_remote_state.vpc.outputs.vpc_id

  # WireGuard port
  ingress {
    from_port   = 51820
    to_port     = 51820
    protocol    = "udp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # Only this should be open to world
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

#### 2. Fix EC2 Security Groups
```hcl
# REPLACE the current SSH rule with VPN-only access
resource "aws_security_group_rule" "ssh_from_vpn_only" {
  type                     = "ingress"
  from_port               = 22
  to_port                 = 22
  protocol                = "tcp"
  source_security_group_id = aws_security_group.vpn_sg.id  # Only from VPN
  security_group_id       = aws_security_group.my_tf_ec2_sg.id
}

# Add RDP access for gaming
resource "aws_security_group_rule" "rdp_from_vpn" {
  type                     = "ingress"
  from_port               = 3389
  to_port                 = 3389
  protocol                = "tcp"
  source_security_group_id = aws_security_group.vpn_sg.id
  security_group_id       = aws_security_group.my_tf_ec2_sg.id
}

# Gaming ports (Steam, Discord, etc.)
resource "aws_security_group_rule" "gaming_ports" {
  type                     = "ingress"
  from_port               = 27000
  to_port                 = 27050
  protocol                = "tcp"
  source_security_group_id = aws_security_group.vpn_sg.id
  security_group_id       = aws_security_group.my_tf_ec2_sg.id
}
```

#### 3. Secure User Data Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# REPLACE current userdata.ssh with this:
sudo su
yum update -y

# Install gaming prerequisites
yum install -y htop tmux fail2ban

# DISABLE password authentication (opposite of current script)
sed -i 's/^PasswordAuthentication yes/PasswordAuthentication no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sed -i 's/^#PasswordAuthentication no/PasswordAuthentication no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Enable fail2ban for SSH protection
systemctl enable fail2ban
systemctl start fail2ban

# Install RDP server for gaming
yum install -y xrdp
systemctl enable xrdp
systemctl start xrdp

# Create gaming user (replace with your setup)
useradd -m gameuser
echo "gameuser:$(openssl rand -base64 32)" | chpasswd
usermod -aG wheel gameuser

systemctl restart sshd
```

### FAMILY ACCESS SOLUTION

#### For Family Members:
1. **Deploy WireGuard VPN server** (above code)
2. **Generate client configs** for each family member
3. **They connect to VPN first**, then access gaming servers
4. **Much more secure** than direct internet exposure

#### Why This Approach:
- **Only 1 port open to internet** (VPN port)
- **All gaming traffic encrypted** through VPN tunnel
- **Easy to manage** family member access
- **Can revoke access** by disabling VPN client configs
- **Protects against ALL attack vectors** currently exposed

## CRITICAL: Remove Current SSH Access

Your current configuration is **extremely vulnerable**:
- SSH open to world = constant brute force attacks
- Password auth enabled = trivial to compromise
- No monitoring = you won't know when compromised

## Implementation Priority

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Deploy VPN server
2. **IMMEDIATE:** Remove SSH access from 0.0.0.0/0
3. **IMMEDIATE:** Disable password authentication  
4. **SOON:** Add RDP and gaming ports through VPN only
5. **SOON:** Set up proper user management

This is **NOT overkill** - this is **basic security** for internet-exposed gaming infrastructure.
